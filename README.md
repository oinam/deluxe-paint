# Deluxe Paint

â†’ [View Deluxe Paint](https://deluxe-paint.oinam.com)

Webbased image editor modeled after the legendary [Deluxe Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint) with a focus on retro Amiga file formats.
Next to modern image formats, DPaint.js can read and write Amiga icon files and IFF ILBM images.

## Free and Open

It runs in your browser, works on any system and works fine on touch-screen devices like iPads.  
It is written in 100% plain JavaScript and has no dependencies.  
It's 100% free, no ads, no tracking, no accounts, no nothing.  
All processing is done in your browser, no data is sent to any server.  

The only part that is not included in this repository is the Amiga Emulator Files.
(The emulator is based on the [Scripted Amiga Emulator](https://github.com/naTmeg/ScriptedAmigaEmulator))

## Building

DPaint.js doesn't need building.  
It also has zero dependencies so there's no need to install anything.  
DPaint.js is written using ES6 modules and runs out of the box in modern browsers.  
Just serve "index.html" from a webserver and you're good to go.  

There's an optional build step to create a compact version of DPaint.js if you like.  
I'm using [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) for this.  
For convenience, I've included a "package.json" file.  
open a terminal and run `npm install` to install Parcel.js and its dependencies.
Then run `npm run build` to create a compact version of DPaint.js in the "dist" folder.
